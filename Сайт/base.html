               <p>Basic online scenario—You log onto your computer and notice that something’s just not right, but you can’t quite put your finger on it. Something just seems…a bit off. If you’ve found yourself in this situation, or even thinking you are, there’s a real possibility you could have a Trojan virus on your computer.</p>
               <br>
               <p> Trojan viruses can not only steal your most personal information, they also put you at risk for identity theft and other serious cybercrimes. In this post, we’ll examine what Trojan viruses are, and where they come from. We’ll also cover how you can protect yourself and get rid of viruses so you can stay safe and maintain peace of mind online.</p>
               <br>
               <p><h2><b>What Trojan Viruses Do</b></h2></p>
               <br>
               <br>
               <p>Trojan viruses are a type of malware that invade your computer disguised as real, operational programs. Once a trojan is inside your system, it can perform destructive actions before you even know it’s there. Once inside, some trojans sit idly on your computer and wait for further instructions from its host hacker, but others begin their malicious activity right from the start.</p>
               <br>
               <p> Some trojans download additional malware onto your computer and then bypass your security settings while others try to actively disable your antivirus software. Some Trojans hijack your computer and make it part of a criminal DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) network.</p>

               <p><h2><b>How to Remove a Trojan Virus</b></h2></p>
               <br>
               <p>Before you discover all the places a Trojan can invade your computer, let’s first learn how to get rid of them. You can remove some Trojans by disabling startup items on your computer which don’t come from trusted sources. For the best results, first reboot your device into safe mode so that the virus can’t stop you from removing it.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Please carefully ensure you know which specific programs you’re removing because you could slow, disable or cripple your system if you remove basic programs your computer needs to function. Installing and using a trusted antivirus solution is also one of the top ways to get rid of trojans. An effective antivirus program searches for valid trust and app behavior, as well as trojan signatures in files in order to detect, isolate and then promptly remove them. In addition to spotting known trojans, the McAfee antivirus program can identify new trojans by detecting suspicious activity inside any and all of your applications.</p>

               <p><h2><b>Remove Trojans by taking the following steps:</b></h2></p>
               <br>
               <p>Removing Trojans is a great way to safeguard your computer and privacy, but you must also take steps to avoid them in the future:</p>
               <br>
               <p> <li>Setup cloud accounts using email addresses that offers account recovery support. Accounts from ISP’s or paid services.</li></p>
               <br>
               <p> <li>In the case of Apple, you can request assistance to help recover an account (Gmail and/or yahoo accounts can’t be recovered as they can’t confirm ownership)</li></p>
               <br>
               <p> <li>Use VPNs on Public Wi-Fi</li></p>
               <br>
               <p> <li>Call the Sender Before Opening Email Attachments</li></p>
               <br>
               <p> <li>Use an Antivirus Solution With Real-Time Protection</li></p>

               <p><h2><b>Where Trojan Viruses Come From</b></h2></p>
               <br>
               <p>This section takes a closer look at the places you are the most vulnerable to a Trojan virus attack. While all trojans look like normal programs, they need a way to get your attention before you unknowingly install them on your system. Trojan viruses are different from other types of malware because they trick you into installing them yourself. You will think that the Trojan is a game or music file, and the file you download will likely work like normal so that you don’t know it’s a Trojan. But it will also install the harmful virus on your computer in the background. Be careful when you get files from the following sources. Many users install trojans from file-sharing websites and fake email attachments. You can also get attacked from spoofed chat messages, infected websites, hacked networks and more.</p>
               <br>
               <p><h2><b>File-Sharing Sites</b></h2></p>
               <br>
               <p> Almost everyone who is at least a little tech savvy occasionally uses file-sharing websites. File-sharing websites include torrent websites and other sites that allow users to share their files, and this concept is appealing for a variety of reasons. First, it allows people to get premium software without paying the retail price. The problem though, is that file-sharing sites are also extremely attractive to hackers who want to find an easy way inside your system.</p>
               <br>
               <p>For example, a hacker uploads a cracked copy of a popular software to a torrent website for free download, then waits for potential victims to instantly download it… but the cracked software has a hidden trojan virus that allows the hacker to control your computer.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Trojan viruses can also come in the popular forms of music files, games and numerous other applications.</p>
